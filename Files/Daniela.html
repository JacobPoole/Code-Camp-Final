	Hello my name is Daniela Perez and Welcome to my website. This website will speak about me. So it will sorta be like a draw my life video but in word form. Here we go. 
I was born on March 2006. My Dad really wanted a boy so when I came out, he screamed yes because I had  A LOT of hair so I looked a boy. ( I still have a lot of hair today and
doing my hair is the worst part of the day.) When the doctor told him it was a girl he was a little disapionted but still happy he was a Dad. I am the oldest child out of 3 children.
 I was a very happy child as I grew up and always connected some way with my family members. I was always very close to my Dad I loved doing every thing with him. At the time he worked at a place were they make ice
cream and always left the house at 3:30 in the morning and came back at 10:00 at night. But he did always get a 3 day weekend, so I was able to hang with him on Fridays, Saturdays,
and Sundays. My mom was the secound person to hang around with but she was a kindergarden teacher so I had to wait till 4:00 to play around with her. The person I enjoyed the most
with was my "big sister" Divina. She was not really my big sister she was my Godsister and 1st coisin. She had school too but she would always come over to my grandma's (where
I lived at the time) house right after to hang out with me, she would skip homework and not eat just so I can enjoy the day while she plays with me. Many people say that the children
are the future and that we will acomplish many things. I was only 6 months old and already knew how to crawl up the stairs. As a child I have already fell in love with music. I loved
to dance. I was still a little girl and did not know how to walk but I did know how to stand. I would clap my hand and turn my shoulders. Then at the end I would make a sound like
yay. At 4 I began to want to play an instrument, espesially the piano so at 5 my mom took me too my first piano class. I became an expert in no time I my teacher started me at a beguining 
level but took me up to adult leavel because I was so good. To my depress My teacher moved 6 months after I started. My mom took me to another teacher this one had to start me all
over again but she saw how I was such an expert that she stook me up to teenage level. I had her for the longest time. Up to 4 years. My younger coisin "Melody" decided to do piano
too because she liked to do every thing that I did. So I decided to go to her piano teacher. I went with her for a long time although the teacher their was about to start me all over
as well but put me on the adult. I wanted to be a rock star my entire life. When I was 6 I was givin a electric guitar. I loved it and was this close to taking guitar lessons too 
bad a strumed it too hard and it broke. Down below I will link some songs that I grew up with. When I was 7 I was givin a radio by the tooth fairy and my "Big sister" gave me a few CD's.
I still have them today. At age 8 I began to dance Ballet Foclorico. This is Mexican foclore dance. Some songs that I dance to will be down below. I sing at the children chior at church. 
I have sense I was 5. I enjoy singing if I don't sing at least once a day, I will die. I am a Mexican American. My father was born and raised in Mexico. At age 15 he crossed the 
border and got a green card to stay here in USA. He resently has became a citizen. My Grandma and Grandpa have lived and started the family in Mexico. But before my mother was born
they came to the USA. My father may have came over but most of his siblings have stayed in Mexico. All those siblings or my aunts and uncles are very dear to me. Sadly, I do not 
get to see them very often. Because of distance I rarley get to speak of see them. I love the coisins that I have thier. We always have much more fun and Enjoyment, because they treat 
me like if I was thier best Friend. Primos si ustedes pueden oírme Te extraño mucho y espero que ustedes estén teniendo lo mejor de la diversión en México. We always sang Despasito
ever since it came out. Its linked down below. I hope you enjoyed this all and please listen to the songs below.
Love,
   Daniela
