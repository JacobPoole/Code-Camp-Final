		Hello, I am Milad Hekmatnia and I am here to tell you about myself. I am currently 13 years old and in a couple of months, I will be attending 9th grade. 
		I was born in Perris, California on the 26th of December in 2003. Although I was born in the United States, my family is Persian. As a result of this I have 
		visited Iran multiple times. I attended a small school in Chino Hills for grades k-2. I still lived in Perris, but my parents would drive to Chino to take me 
		to school. Once I was in third grade, I started attending Avalon elementary school which was about a mile drive. This was the first time that I had attended 
		a public school so things were alot different. In sixth grade I attended Sierra Vista Elementary school. The most important time was 7th and 8th grade where 
		I went to Lakeside Middle School. These two years were by far the best years of my life. In 7th and 8th grade, I was in scholar classes which made the whole 
		experience alot better. This was due to the fact that all the kids in my class wanted to learn and took school seriously, so nobody would cause a disturbance.
		 It was an amazing year where I met all my friends and people that I will hopefully know for the rest of my life. Now I will get away from the academic part 
		of my life and I will talk more about my interests. All my life I have loved all sports but I have always especially loved basketball. This is mainly because 
		of my fathers love for the game which led me to have the same love for basketball. From a young age I have loved the Lakers. Even though they are currently 
		one of the worst teams in the league, I will stick by them and support them through the difficulties. Other than basketball, I also love playing video games. 
		As you can probably guess, the video game I play the most is NBA 2k17. My other interests is in cars. I have always had an interests in not only supercars, 
		but also classic cars. Lastly, I also love animals As a result own a rat terrier named Daisy who I have had for around 8 years.
