	Hello, my name is Andrea Tercero and I am a student from Lakeside Middle School in Perris, Ca. I was born on October 16,2004 and right now I am in 8th grade Scholars. I have three siblings, two of them already graduated from universities (my oldest sibling graduated from UC Davis and my second oldest sibling graduated from UCSB) and my other sibling has graduated from Rancho Verde High School. I like to watch Steven Universe, Attack on Titan, Pokemon, SpongeBob SquarePants, and many other shows.Some of the favorite video games I like to play are Minecraft, Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, GTA V, GTA San Andreas, Call of Duty, Halo, and many other video games. I used to live in Montebello but after 5th grade, I moved to Perris and then for 6th grade I went to Val Verde for only a year. This was not my first time living in Perris, before when I was I little, we lived in Perris but in a different area. But then we moved to Montebello for some reason that I don't remember of.</div></p>

I am able to speak to languages which are Spanish and English. I have 3 different kinds of pets a dog, a cat, and an iguana. I like to draw on paper and on computer (but it's much more harder), play video games, paint, play chess, and more. My favorite color is blue (and any kind of blues) and I have many interests from many kinds of things. When I have time, I like to call my friends and play online games with them. I also like to watch youtube videos with my friends when I call them.</a></div>
