	Salutations, My name is Isaiah Wu Siapno. Born into a Taiwanese-Philipino family in 2004, I had been an only child until 2007 when my brother Samuel was born. 
	Over the 12 years I have lived I have made many great decisions and, consequencial ones. Although I had made some bad decisions I always focused when it came to school work.
	In school I have achieved things such as: Student of The Month, Perfect Attendence, Honor Roll and, Principal's Honor Roll. As a result of getting Student of The Month I was then chosen for Student of The Year in 6th grade which was one of the biggest accomplisments of my life.
	In total I probably have over 50 or 60 awards for school academics. Even though I have many awards and, may seem like a nerd I am not. I have many other things I love to do such as watch The Flash,play basketball, practice karate, and play Pokemon. I also love to eat many foods such as hamburgers, pizza, sweet and sour pork, etc.

	Playing Pokemon has been a hobby I had started late in the month of October. I have collected and, opened many packs of Pokemon and, doing this has made it an addiction that I can't break. Overall I have about 400 to 450 cards. I also have started going to a Pokemon League and, have met many new people that have taught me more about the game and, helped me with my collection.
	I also have gone to some conventions that you can trade and, pay for cards. The convention have also expanded my collection and, have almost made my Pokemon playing deck unbeatable.

	 I also love to play basketball. I have played since I was 6 and have 4 years recreational ball experience and, 2 years of AAU travel ball experience. Overall I have maybe 500 points or more throughout the years I have been playing for coaches. I also having been watching the NBA for years to get better as well. My favorite player is Kyrie Irving since he has the best shooting form and, the smoothest of finishes.

	As a 12 year old attached to The Flash series I also love to binge watch The Flash and, many other shows. When I have free time and, a new season of The Flash come out I at least spend 3 to 5 hours watching all the episodes and, rewatching them. I have become so obsessed with speed that I want to be struck by lightning but, I know that there is literally a 1 in 1 million percent chance that I could be hit by lightning.
